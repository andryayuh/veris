By using those particular keys together the attacker gained unauthorized access to three of our AWS EC2 instances and a subset of our AWS S3 buckets. Those AWS resources included user credentials for the Datadog service, service metadata, and credentials shared with Datadog for third-party integrations. Forensics show the attacker activity commenced on 2016-07-07 at 19:44 UTC and ceased on 2016-07-08 at 06:18 UTC. We began our response on 2016-07-08 at 14:46 UTC.",
